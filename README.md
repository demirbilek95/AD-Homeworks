# AD-Homeworks

This repository includes the homeworks of Algorithm Design.

## Structure of files

* `benchmark & tests` : These folders includes result of performance tests as `txt` file, python plot scripts and plots or also the test scripts which is written in `C`.
* `include` : This folder includes all the header files
* `src` : This folder includes all the source codes
* `report` : This folder includes original homeworks and reports related the homeworks which includes all explanations. Also you can find a shortcut belove for reports.

To compile and run the code `01-Strassen` and `04-Dijkstra` folders have `Makefile` so simply `make` command will be sufficient to compile the code. For the rest, each folder has `CMakeLists.txt` file so `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" CMakeLists.txt` command will produce a `MakeFile`. After that again simply `make` command will be sufficient to have executable.
